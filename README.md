# emgl

Some personal experiments in writing C++ code that gets run in the browser. I
may be doing everything wrong, but it should be fun. So far this doesn't
really do anything.

## Motivations

I want to learn some C++ by writing it, not just reading examples from books.
I also want to get a feel for asm.js and emscripten with the pipeline and
how debugging works (if at all) in the browser.
